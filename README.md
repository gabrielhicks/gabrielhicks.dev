# gabrielhicks.dev

This is the third version of my web development and software engineering portfolio. My first was a simple React application which morphed into something that resembles this current iteration. I decided to redesign and redevlop my page with Next.js for the SEO benefits and for my future plans to integrate my blog as well as some blogs that will go alongside each of my projects to docuemnt my expierneces working on them.

## Anatomy

Currently I only have one landing page that prominently displays my most current projects from my time at Flatiron School. After my Flatiron projects I have listed Open Source projects I have contributed to as well as links to their respective repos.

## Fork, Clone, Run

If you are interested I would encourage you to feel free to clone or fork down this repo.

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:gabrielhicks/portfoliov2.git
$ cd portfoliov2
$ yarn install
$ yarn dev
```
