<Heading>What is an API and why would I want to use one?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  As a new developer, I have often heard of APIs, but never fully understood
  what they were. An Application Programming Interface is a tool that
  purposefully makes data accessible, and specifically defines how, and in what
  ways we can interact with this data. APIs usually have thorough documentation
  that is both technical and practical, detailing many designed user
  experiences.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>What is RESTClient and JSON?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  REST(**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer) Client, in our case, is a
  Ruby gem that acts as an intermediary between us and our API that collects a
  ‘response’. JSON(**J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation) is another
  translator, which takes the objects collected by RESTClient from our API
  request, and ‘parses’ that data, formatting the objects in our response into
  an easily accessible hash.

<Heading>
  Now that we have an overview of these tools, how do we use them?
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  In our project, we decided to allow a user to create playlists dependent on
  their mood. We needed to import song data from Spotify into a database, so
  that it would be accessible to a user while our app was functioning. We
  designed algorithms to choose songs for any given playlist, based on audio
  feature data and metrics that Spotify assigns to every individual track.

  Step 1: Accessing your Spotify Credentials and Authorizing your App
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Log into Spotify’s [developer
  interface](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications), and click
  the green ‘Create An App’ button. You will be prompted to name and describe
  your app. When you are finished you will check the boxes, submit, and be
  redirected to the dashboard that your _authorization **depends** on_. Copy and
  save your ‘Client ID’ and ‘Client Secret’, these are your secret codes to
  access the API.

<Heading>Step 2: Whitelisting a Redirect URI</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Before you leave the developer dashboard, you will need to white list a
  redirect URI. You can do this by going to the ‘Edit Settings’ button, and
  clicking ‘Add’ under Redirect URIs. Using
  [https://example.com/callback/](https://example.com/callback/) as our Redirect
  URI will work for our purposes!
</Paragraph>

</Paragraph>

<Heading>
  Step 3: Using our Spotify Credentials to generate an Access Token
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Next, we will use the Redirect URI we whitelisted in Step 3 to give us the
  access token! Copy this URI and paste it into a [URL
  encoder](https://www.urlencoder.org/). It should look something like this
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">
    " "_https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback%2F" "
  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  We are now going to do surgery. Spotify’s Implicit Grant Flow tells us we need
  to use our encoded URI and our client id, formatted into this specific
  address:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">
    "
    https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOURCLIENTIDHERE&redirect_uri=YOURENCODEDURIHERE&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&response_type=token&state=123
    "
  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  My address, after using my Client ID and URI, looked like this:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">
    "
    https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOURCLIENTIDHERE&redirect_uri=YOURENCODEDURIHERE&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&response_type=token&state=123)8449a8d2ab9b40f8b14324f3a22a368d[&redirect_uri=](https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOURCLIENTIDHERE&redirect_uri=YOURENCODEDURIHERE&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&response_type=token&state=123)https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback%2F[&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&response_type=token&state=123](https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=YOURCLIENTIDHERE&redirect_uri=YOURENCODEDURIHERE&scope=user-read-private%20user-read-email&response_type=token&state=123
    "
  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Divider />

<Paragraph>
  We now, are going to paste this constructed address into our browser. We will
  be directed to a Spotify page to authorize our app!

  We are not done here! Don’t close this web page yet!
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  If you look in the address bar, you will see a peculiar web address, hopefully
  the one you whitelisted in your Spotify dashboard… however… it also includes
  our very own Access Token!!!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">

    "
  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Copy and save the Access Token, which includes everything after
  _#access_token=_and before _&token_type=Bearer_. This token type is important
  to note, we will also use this later on.
</Paragraph>

_NOTE: Access Tokens will only work for 60 minutes, if the token expires, you can repeat this step for an additional 60 minutes of access._

<Heading>Step 4: Setting up the app environment</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Now, we need to create the app! I’ll use this boilerplate CLI design, and call
  it "medium_cli_app". We next need to add the gem ‘rest-client’ to our Gemfile
  and bundle install. We are using ActiveRecord and Rake to seed data into a
  database, so we will also need these gems included, however I already had them
  in my template. Within our db/seeds.rb we will need to require both ‘json’ and
  ‘rest-client’.
</Paragraph>

_Don’t forget to save!_

</Paragraph>

<Heading>
  Step 5: Using RESTClient and JSON to make an API request and parse a response
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Back in our app seeds.rb file, we are going to create an "auth" variable so
  that we can easily pass it into our GET requests. This structure will be a
  hash, with the key "Authorization"" and the value of your Access Token type,
  followed by your Access Token as a single string.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">
    " auth = _"Authorization": "Bearer
    BQDc2NzoRj2M6I4WPRdYdjNsyzrhtYP1cPq4fJge44dQvpg90hOab6aRPylW8IZONZwMM1jh3d5ffapk1FsMcV9gsrBFIyu3U2b0–3u\_\_8XvFOr0D7p_iqF3uEFr-VI7DoFcW3bBsI_2fE1fntrjZ97buywackYoEYc"_
    "
  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Next, we will use a RestClient.get request, pass a Spotify API Endpoint in,
  and as a second arguement, our auth variable set as a header.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">
"
    **endpoint1 **= RestClient.get(
 "   ‘https://api.spotify.com/v1/browse/categories/mood/playlists?offset=0&limit=50',
    headers=**auth**)

  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Last, we will use a JSON.parse() method to parse the variable we set our
  RestClient.get response to.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph textAlign="center">
  <Code wordBreak="break-all" textAlign="left">
    " **data1** = JSON.parse(**endpoint1**) "
  </Code>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Our final product, will look similar to this in our seeds.rb file:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>

<Image
  alt={`We are almost there`}
  src={'/static/blogs/access-spotify/image6.jpg'}
  width={1162}
  height={636}

_We are almost there!!!_

</Paragraph>

<Heading>
  Step 6: Strategically importing Spotify’s Web API data into a database
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Here is where you come in! Once we have made authorized our GET requests, we
  can more effectively utilize Spotify’s Web API documentation to determine
  endpoints we wish to access. We can preform endless methods on this collected
  data and use endless methods to seed it into our database. I will show a
  couple examples of how I used this access to parse, collect, and persist data
  points into my database.

<Heading>Final Thoughts</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  This is not a comprehensive guide on API authorization. What this method
  allowed me to do, is overcome the barrier of entry into the wealth of value
  APIs can offer. I frantically searched Google, Medium, Youtube, GitHub, and
  tried various Ruby gems specifically designed for accessing Spotify’s API but
  could not find a step by step approach (with images) how to be granted access.
  This is a jumping off place, I look forward to learning and understanding more
  dynamic ways of utilizing these tools. After my experience, I have deepened my
  respect for the traditional documents that as developers we often find
  ourselves. If you need any additional help, or would just like a person to
  walk through authorization with, reach out to me and I will see if I can be of
  some use to you!
