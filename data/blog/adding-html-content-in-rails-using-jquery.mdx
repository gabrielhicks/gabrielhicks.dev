<Paragraph>
  While working on a new Rails project, I was tasked with creating a comment
  model and implementing the ability to add comments to a video’s show page. I
  needed to be able to access both the video and comment models, add comments to
  the video page, display newly added comments, all without interrupting the
  runtime of the video. Through trial and error, and dissecting various
  tutorials for older versions of Rails, as well as other programming languages,
  I found a working method using jQuery and a few snippets of Ruby code.

  Have a working Rails app with a User, Video/Post/Other, and a Comments joining
  model
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  I am making the assumption that if you have found this blog, you already have
  a functioning Rails app, and are interested in the method I used to add
  comments without refreshing a page. To start you will need at least a User
  model, in my case a Video model, and a Comment model that will join the two
  previous.

  The User model has many comments, the Video model has many comments, and
  Comments belong to Users and Videos. Be sure to add a nested route for your
  video resources, the code within _routes.rb_ should look something like this:

<Heading>Add jQuery to your Rails application</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  To add jQuery to a Rails 6 app, there are a few quick things to do. First we
  need to add *gem ‘jquery-rails’ *to our Gemfile. Next you will need to add
  _require(“jquery”)_ within your _application.js_ file (mine was located at
  app/javascript/packs). Finally we will add the following block of code in the
  middle of our _config/webpack/environment.js_ file. Last, you will need to run
  _‘yarn add jquery’_ within your root directory to ensure everything will work
  properly.

  Create comment forms, and prepare them to be rendered within the Video show
  page
</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  To create a new comment in Rails, we need to make a form that will take in the
  User, the Video and the content body of the comment. We will save this as a
  partial called _\_form.html.erb_ within our comment’s view file.
</Paragraph>

/>

_A form_for with parameters set to “remote: true”, that will be rendered to submit a new comment in the application._

<Divider />

<Paragraph>
  This is the form that I wrote. Ignore the classes and placeholder, what is
  important here is the arguments that form_for is taking. These arguments
  correspond with the comments controller within the new and create methods,
  passing the information needed to persist a comment to the database. The
  remote: true argument is saying the form is going to call the action that you
  specify for it.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Within our video show page, we will now render the comment form at the bottom.
  Above this partial, nested within a _div_ tag, is where normally we would
  display comments while iterating through a collection. Instead, I am using
  jQuery to target an id I specified in the _div_ tag, which will render this
  section separate from the video playing at the top. This render is looking for
  a file we need to create called _\_comment.html.erb._

<Paragraph>
  At this point our video show page’s comment section will look something like
  the photo above. Now we get to add the corresponding *create.js.erb *file that
  is going to pair with our create comment action listed within the comments
  controller. Be sure to comment out any redirects you may have had previously,
  as these will refresh your page and counter the methods we are trying to
  utilize.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Now that we have made a _create.js.erb_ page within our comments view file, it
  is time to fill it with some jQuery! I wanted to accomplish two things in
  this, first was to add a comment to a page that would display without
  refreshing, second is to reset the comment content after adding a comment. To
  accomplish these goals we only need two lines of code that will target our
  specified ids and classes.

<Divider />

<Paragraph>
  The first argument in each line is where the comment*pane id, and comment
  class were targeted. Following these arguments are actions, *.append* which
  will add it’s following code to the bottom of an item, and *.val\_ which sets
  the value of the comment class to an empty string (or return to placeholder
  value).

  After saving all of your files, you should now have a functioning comment
  button, that will add comments without refreshing your page!
