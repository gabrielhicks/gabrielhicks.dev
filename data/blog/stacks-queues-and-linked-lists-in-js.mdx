<Heading>What are data structures?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  In computer science, data structures are particular formats utilized in the
  organization, management, and processing of data. There are many data
  structures that vary greatly in complexity. Essentially, a data structure
  exists to store information while creating a pathway to retrieve and use that
  information efficiently. Some data structures you may have seen before are
  arrays, hash tables, linked lists, trees, and graphs.

<Heading>What is a Stack?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Stacks are structures that have conformity to the principle of
  Last-In-First-Out (LIFO). Real world representations are everywhere, while
  washing dishes or folding towels, anything that can be stacked will be
  unstacked starting with the object that was last placed on top. The first item
  in the stack will be the last item used in the stack. Arrays as well as
  asynchronous requests in JavaScript use this order of operations when
  executed.

<Heading>What is a Queue?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  A queue can be thought of the inverse of a stack. Queues conform to the
  principle First-In-First-Out (FIFO). Also well represented in real life, any
  time you stand in line for a service, you expect to move in one direction
  toward the front of the line. Arrays can be used to implement queues in
  JavaScript.

<Heading>How can I use stacks and queues in JavaScript?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  If using an array as a stack, JavaScript provides the methods <i>push()</i>{' '}
  and <i>pop()</i>. To demonstrate use cases:
</Paragraph>

<Code>

// set a variable stack to an array of numbers
let stack = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// to remove an item from the **top** of the stack, we will use the pop() method
stack.pop() // the number 5 will be removed from the **top** of the stack
console.log(stack) // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
// to add an item to the **top** of the stack, we will use the push() method
stack.push(9) // the number 9 will be added to the **top** of the stack
console.log(stack) // [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9]

</Code>

<Paragraph>
  We have similar use cases to utilize an array as a queue in JavaScript as
  well, with the _push()_ and _shift()_ methods
</Paragraph>

<Code>

// set a variable queue to an array of numbers
let queue = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// to remove an item from the **front** of the queue, we will use the shift() method
queue.shift() // the number 0 will be removed from the **front** of the queue
console.log(queue) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// to add an item to the **end **of the queue, we will use the push() method
queue.push(6) // the number 6 will be added at the **end** of the queue
console.log(stack) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

</Code>

<Heading>Why?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  The previous examples may seem glum, boring, or dull, but as data becomes more
  sophisticated they will be incredibly vital to know and understand in order to
  traverse data efficiently. When using stacks and queues, our computer is
  looping through each element in the array while re-indexing those elements
  which results in greater time complexity. Linked lists are usually the best
  choice when dealing with large amounts of data. They provide easier access to
  directly move items, without the need to re-index an array.

<Heading>Linked Lists: An overview</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  A JavaScript developer at any level can appreciate the utility of an array.
  However, as applications grow more complex, insertion and deletion of items in
  particular becomes increasingly more efficient using a linked list. The
  anatomy of a linked list is either a node, which points to another node in one
  direction, or a node which points directly behind and directly in front of
  itself. This chain is effective to climb back and forth on without needing to
  re-index the collective data. Stacks and queues are patterns that can be seen
  and used in both arrays as well as linked lists.
