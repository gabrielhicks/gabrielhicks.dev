<Paragraph>
  I recently started an exciting side project with my two best friends! One of
  my friends is a seasoned web developer, turned SCRUM Master, who we will
  reference as â€˜Bâ€™. My other friend, â€˜Râ€™, is a self-taught JavaScript developer
  who is interested in learning React. I am a React enthusiast, so we set out to
  develop a PERN (PostgreSQL, Express, React and Node.js) stack application
  together. â€˜Bâ€™ is taking the lead as project manager, as well as leading the
  initial backend and API development, while I try to lead my incredibly smart
  friend â€˜Râ€™ through the basics of React in our initial setup of the frontend.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Less than half an hour into initializing repositories, â€˜Bâ€™ came to us with a
  fully built out Trello board, equip with diagrams, rendered images,
  incremental goals, and task assignments. This was incredible, as it is how I
  imagine an industry workflow would be, however, I repeatedly saw the words
  <b>tests, testing,</b> and <b>test</b> littered everywhere. It was in this moment,
  I realized I would be spending significant time learning how to write tests in
  a way that may lead my SCRUM Master friend into thinking I had known how to all
  along.

<Paragraph>
  I quickly sought out sordid places, finding the JavaScript testing world to be
  something like the Wild West. I stumbled upon and continued to circle back to
  a gentleman from Utah called{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds">
    <u>Kent C. Dodds</u>
  </a>
  , who had extensive experience, as well as countless blogs, videos, and open source
  courses how to test JavaScript and React applications. I quickly took to a couple
  of Kentâ€™s public repositories of his reputable courses
  <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library-course">
    <u> TestingJavaScript </u>
  </a>
  and <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-react-apps">
    <u>EpicReact</u>
  </a>, and sent a very basic unit test to â€˜Bâ€™ in which my friend replied "looks
  good enough to me".
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <Heading color="grey" fontWeight="400">
    It worked! In a short few hours, I had regained confidence in myself, and
    seemingly blown away the expectations my friend may have had of me in
    regards to my testing abilities!
  </Heading>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I will provide some quick code snippet example that are based off of Kentâ€™s
  teachings from his{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-react-apps">
    <u>EpicReact â€” Testing React Apps</u>
  </a>{' '}
  repository that I applied to the application I am currently developing with my
  friends.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The initial test I sent â€˜Bâ€™ was a direct reflection of the base knowledge in
  the first iteration of exercises. This first test was written only using
  React, ReactDOM, and Jest. It looked something like this:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import Counter from '../../components/Home';

test('index page is rendered reading Hello World', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');

  document.body.append(div);

  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);

  const helloWorld = div.querySelector('h1');

  expect(helloWorld.textContent).toMatch(/hello world/i);
});
```

<Paragraph>
  As I continued on learning after gaining the confidence of my team members, I
  evolved this first test, implementing some new methods from
  react-testing-library I picked up along the way. My refactored first test, my
  second organically written test ever, now looked like this:
</Paragraph>

```jsx
    import { render } from '@testing-library/react';
    import * as React from 'react';
    import App from './App';

    test(index page is rendered reading Hello World', () => {

        const { container } = render(<App />);

        const helloWorld = container.querySelector('h1');

        expect(helloWorld.textContent).toMatch(/hello world/i);

    })
```

<Paragraph>
  I learned the benefits of using RTL, such as not needing to clean up elements
  from the DOM, as well as not needing to create a div, as it would be done for
  me. Moreover what I learned, was that testing wasnâ€™t so scary. In fact,
  testing with its easy readability, and very familiar syntax was actually kind
  of fun! I am still continuing to learn every hour as I push through this
  material, but am finding what I am struggling with and lacking must be within
  the full coursework and missing video accompaniment of EpicReact.

<Paragraph>
  I am now dedicated to developing more unit, integration, and end-to-end
  testing methods, and look forward to sharing my journey here. I highly
  encourage every new or newer developer if they havenâ€™t already to give testing
  a shot. Definitely seek our trusted and transparent sources like Kent, and
  have confidence in your abilities as engineers.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I felt as if I was late to the game in this specific area, but in other areas
  I have been able to encourage and aid my other friend â€˜Râ€™s journey learning
  React. With the body of knowledge and easy to access materials available on
  the internet, the only thing standing in the way is taking the action.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I am a life long learner, and I am far from where I want to be at in my
  knowledge, but I am lightyears ahead of where I thought I might be one year
  ago today. I look forward and embrace this New Year as the year of
  â€˜realizationâ€™. Through the simple action of learning how to write an extremely
  basic test in a friendly project environment, I feel hopeful and empowered to
  push forward in spite of myself with that same energy in all things in 2021.
