<Heading>What is Open Source?</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Open Source Software (OSS) can be defined as any software that has been
  released for the purposes of giving other people the rights to study, use,
  change, contribute to, and distribute the software. There are often licenses
  and documentation accompanying the source code that detail specific rights and
  information regarding the open source project.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  If you are familiar with GitHub, you are familiar with the concept of open
  source collaboration. The technology Git was designed precisely for this
  purpose. With Git and GitHub, developers have a version-control system as well
  as a platform to collaboratively develop and share software solutions in
  public.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Think of the idiom _two heads are better than one._ With open source software,
  a project idea or software feature can rapidly develop with the only
  requirement being that the person contributing be able to come to understand
  the technologies involved. GitHub repositories enable this type of
  collaboration through creating “issues”, as well as enabling developers to
  comment and reply to code submissions.

<Paragraph>
  I made my first contribution in October during
  [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) presented by Digital
  Ocean. My older brother encouraged me to participate even though I was in the
  midst of my coding bootcamp. The first pull request I made was to add alt text
  to images, improving accessibility for an application. During this event I was
  even able to tackle an issue for a Python/Flask project, a language in which I
  was not familiar. With the help of my brother, as well as other sources on the
  internet, I developed, tested, submitted and had my request merged to the main
  branch!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  If you are able to see a problem, then develop and test a solution to a
  problem, you are ready to start contributing to open source projects. However,
  most projects will have _CONTRIBUTING.md_ and _README.md_ documentation that
  outline _how_ contributions should be made. **It is possible to make a bad
  contribution.** Hacktoberfest, which celebrates open source contribution, this
  year had to make some major changes. There was an influx of meaningless or
  negligent contributions being submitted as people sought out the t-shirt that
  comes with 5 successful contributions during the event. Before you submit a
  pull-request on an issue, be confident that you are providing a thoughtful
  addition to the codebase.

  Hacktoberfest, where my open source journey began, has an amazing list of
  resources and detailed information how to make quality pull requests. I will
  list some of their curated resources all of which I used to begin
  contributing.

<Heading>How to make a pull request</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  The first step in contributing is finding a project that you want to work on
  with issues open. Many major frameworks and libraries will have hundreds of
  issues open at a time. You will notice tags below the issue number, many will
  rank the urgency of the issue and display the issue’s nature.

  In the photo above, it shows issue #23 asking for help creating unit tests.
  Next to the title of the issue are indications that they want help solving
  this issue, as well as indicating it is good for first time contributors to
  tackle.

  When you further inspect the issue, you can read a longer description of the
  issue’s nature as well as some direction in how to address it. You will also
  notice contributors commenting and suggesting how they can help. This kind of
  open and friendly communication has been my experience when working on open
  source projects.

<Paragraph>
  Finally, when you have written code that solves the issue, and in accordance
  with the *CONTRIBUTING.md *documentation, you will open a pull-request and
  provide the desired information. After a review, the code may be merged into
  the project, or the creator of the issue may give further direction to improve
  the code. Once the pull-request has been approved, it is merged to the main
  branch and you have successfully become a contributor!

  Last, I’d like to shoutout an open source project started by a friendly
  developer, it is also the project in the images above. The Sylar Project is a
  repository that helps users more easily find mental health resources in their
  local area. Below I have linked the project itself as well as the blogs Rahat
  has written about the inception and the progress that has been made!

  Find a project that is meaningful to you, whether it is a popular framework or
  library you enjoy using, or for a company or cause that you believe in. Any
  contribution, no matter how small it may seem, helps that project move in a
  positive direction. You will gain valuable and practical experience and
  continue growing as a developer.
