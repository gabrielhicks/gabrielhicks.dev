<Heading>My motivation and origin story</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  First, let me introduce myself. I am who I am today because I grew up
  alongside the modern web. At the age of 7, my life dramatically changed when
  visiting one of my favorite gaming websites, Miniclip. I saw a new
  advertisement at the top that read RuneScape. It was in this moment that I
  knew I would inevitably grow up to become a software engineer.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Although I wasn’t great at the game, I was enamored by the yellow floating
  text and the friends I had made on the other side of the screen. I convinced
  many of my friends to play if they weren’t already, and stayed connected with
  some through the game when they would move away or change schools.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I owe much to RuneScape, it is where I learned how to type, and how to read
  and write <i>leetspeak</i>. For many years it was a central part of my online
  identity. As the game’s developers improved their skill, the 2.5D graphics
  became lackluster in comparison to other games, and in short time they
  released an "improved" iteration of the game. I vowed to never abandon the
  home I had made on RuneScape Classic.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Through cheating communities and private server forums, I found a solution to
  my problem, in order to play the game I loved, I needed to learn something
  deeper about computers and computer programming. I made a new host of friends
  in these niche chatrooms and as a community, manage to keep the game we grew
  up with alive to this day.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Essentially, a small collective of developers devoted countless hours
  rebuilding, maintaining, and updating a game that was intended to die in 2003.
  Not only did they reverse engineer the game, the forums were filled with ample
  documentation, and open source files. It was through these years of my life I
  wrote my first scripts, first traversed codebase, and hosted my own game
  servers that I could play on with old friends and to show proudly to my
  family.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I fancied myself a "hacker-man" and "tech guru" for most of my adolescence. I
  was the go-to person for my brothers and their friends when they needed
  computers fixed, promotional videos edited, or information they themselves had
  trouble sniffing out on Google. I saw my love and passion for all things
  internet as a part of me, and my identity.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Through high school and into college I kept my hobby with computer engineering
  close, but chose to start traversing a path in business school.

_My lovely fiancé Emily and I after a Valentine’s Day date_

<Divider />

<Paragraph>
  Fast-forward to the winter of 2019, I found myself as an electrician working
  very long days in the frozen tundra of Iowa. My fiancé, Emily, had applied and
  was beginning to hear back from graduate school programs and we were
  envisioning a future together away from both of our homes. We talked intensely
  about how far we may be moving away, what that would look like, our dreams,
  passions, and goals in life.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  As Emily worked hard through interviews, and inevitably decided to pursue a
  program in New York City, we sought advice from anyone willing to give it.
  After countless heart-to-heart’s, soul searching, and guidance from people we
  trusted, we knew this was the time and opportunity to pursue our dreams
  together in a new place. I liked the work that I had been doing, but I had a
  sudden moment of clarity, perhaps a quarter life crisis, and poured my heart
  out to my partner about my dream to become a software engineer.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Fortunately for me, I had a small host of resources to question about this
  goal of mine and how to navigate it. My brother is a senior software engineer,
  my best friend a SCRUM master, and my cousin co-founded freeCodeCamp — to say
  the very least I had a great support system. Both my and Emily’s families were
  incredibly supportive and excited for both of us in our new adventure. I
  considered the many steps that I may need to take in order to be successful in
  the City that Never Sleeps.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I planned to find or develop a structured learning path. I wanted to find a
  way to make new friends, and I wanted a network of people that I could plug
  into to become a part of the industry. For all of these reasons and by the
  recommendation of my support system, I came to the conclusion that attending a
  coding bootcamp could help me reach my goal in a meaningful and structured
  way.
</Paragraph>

<Heading>Bootcamp</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  If you are anything like me, you may currently be reading your second or third
  blog post, cross examining content in search of the truth on coding bootcamps,
  or how to change careers. You may be researching a couple months before
  applying, or you may have recently applied and are seeking positive
  affirmations. Whatever the case, you have found good company here, as this is
  exactly where I was one year ago.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I began my search and preparation in my normal fashion, I started Googling. I
  found any and every shred of information on how to learn how to code and
  coding bootcamps, and comparing each resource against the next to distill what
  I consider a generally suggested path. I also utilized the resources I had
  built in with friends and family. This research and development helped me
  formulate the following plan:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  <BlockQuote>
    <OrderedList>
      <ListItem>
        Start freeCodeCamp’s web development and JS certification courses
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>Enroll in and begin work with Harvard’s CS-50 course</ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Seek out and rank my top choices for in-person coding bootcamps
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Enroll and start each bootcamp prep course, at least finishing one
      </ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Apply, interview, and be accepted into a program by July 4th
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
  </BlockQuote>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I will include an exhaustive list at the end of content creators and other
  various resources and media that heavily influence this plan of attack.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The first two weeks of the new year, I was off to the races with freeCodeCamp.
  I was working out of town and staying in a hotel, the only thoughts on my mind
  each 11+ hour day, was how I couldn’t wait to get back to the hotel and start
  working on HTML and CSS. I worked hard during the day, and even harder at
  night to push through and successfully complete the first test I set up for
  myself.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Next, I simultaneously, and in an unorganized fashion, began freeCodeCamp’s
  JavaScript certificate, as well as App Academy, Flatiron School, and
  Galvanize’s bootcamp prep programs. I managed to make it through every
  resource up to, and through the introduction of objects. Each curriculum and
  coursework walked through basic data types, looping, conditionals, and I found
  myself lost when comparing each program’s explanation and teaching style of
  objects.

      <i>Then COVID began…</i>

</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  At the onset of COVID, and continuously through my progress I had been
  emailing admissions from each coding bootcamp listed above, seeking advice and
  resources how to best move forward. I also continued consuming YouTube
  content, reading Reddit, and reading any daily reviews that had been posted on
  the top coding bootcamp boards. It was my lovely fiancé who helped me make a
  decision to finally see one of these preparatory programs out to the end. I
  paid for the App Academy bootcamp prep course, and symbolically planted my
  stake in my new future as a software engineer.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  After putting my money where my mouth was, I continued completing a majority
  of Flatiron’s bootcamp prep, and working through the freeCodeCamp JavaScript
  materials. For financial and professional reasons, work conflicted with my
  studies during the months of April and May. COVID was now a thing so naturally
  Emily and I cancelled our lease and moved into my parents basement. Through
  the end of May and June I helped my parents finish their basement, adding a
  living room and bathroom, and worked as much as I could on research and coding
  problems.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I set a goal to be accepted into a program by July, was moving across the
  country in August, so June 1st I diligently worked through the a/A bootcamp
  prep. I applied and interviewed with Flatiron, App Academy, and Hack Reactor.
  My decision in the end was based upon a few criteria:

<Paragraph>
  On June 30th, I had a technical interview with Gracie from Flatiron, and by
  July 9th I was officially enrolled in the Flatiron School Software Engineering
  program!
</Paragraph>

_<Paragraph>
Additional contributing factors to why I chose Flatiron included the
overwhelming and supportive communal feeling I received while onboarding
with Maryssa and Gracie. I also learned and loved "Feelings Fridays" which
made it a no-brainer for me, as I am an expressive and transparent person. I
am unaware if/what support systems exist at the other bootcamps since I did
not personally attend them.</Paragraph>_

<Heading>The move, and starting Flatiron School</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Emily and I moved to New York City with the help of her parents in late July.
  I brought one bag of luggage and a backpack, we didn’t have furniture and
  hadn’t seen the apartment in which we would be living. For me, this experience
  was wonderfully simple, it was not easy, but the nature of the move and the
  status of the world in that moment made it very simple to drop everything and
  start fresh in a new place.

<Paragraph>
  When you are officially admitted into the Flatiron School, you will in short
  order receive access to their online platform, and a mandatory pre-work
  section that should be completed before day 1. Since I did almost all of my
  bootcamp prep courses in JavaScript I felt I had some catching up to do in
  Ruby. In a little more than two weeks I had worked through all of the material
  provided and was set to start with my cohort on August 24th.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Most of us had all prepared for the world to reopen, and to return to campus
  in September. The night before our start date, we received notice that the
  entirety of our bootcamp would be online. If it hadn’t been for the pleasant
  onboarding experience, and a previous interaction with a cohort-mate, I would
  have considered postponing my course until I could attend in person. With the
  confidence of having at least one friend in class, he and I hopped on a Zoom
  call to simulate the intended experience of being at a table together on day
  1.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  As a cohort we had several ice breaker sessions to get to know each other
  which was very nice. I took it upon myself to begin reaching out to a couple
  more students I had interacted with, and struck up conversations. I made
  strong friendships early on that helped me open up and ask for help, as well
  as have people to confide in when I felt off. Slowly but surely as we
  progressed through the course, our cohort grew into a real family. We made a
  Slack for all of us to chat off the record, and have supported each other the
  whole way.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  As the bootcamp carried on through it’s 5 iterations of 3 week sprints, I
  developed some personal goals:
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>

    <OrderedList>
      <ListItem>To pass each module</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Make real friendships and bonds</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Deploy and host each project</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Find ways to help others like me</ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
  </BlockQuote>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Before committing to any bootcamp, I studied and compared things like job
  placement and attrition rates. I fought and continue to fight everyday against
  the constant feeling that I am an imposter. I had taken notes and made plans
  for what I could do after failing two modules to recoup my investment and
  still be able to chase my dream. With ample help from new friends, coaches,
  and instructors, I was successful in meeting my first three goals, and will
  pursue the fourth goal throughout my lifetime.

<Heading>Final Project</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  After completing my fourth and final coding challenge, and presenting my final
  project with an amazing parter, I had developed some level of confidence in my
  ability. The fear and anxiety of the final module, as well as being admitting
  into the career services portion of the program however, was unmatched. I
  determined to follow through my last section of bootcamp on the same strict
  schedule I had previously. I woke up before 7, showered, ate, and was on my
  computer by 9.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I had heard of a place called tutorial purgatory, also known as tutorial hell.
  I decided to develop a platform that attempted to combine the things I felt
  were essential in my success this far and called it [Tutorial
  Heaven](https://tutorial-heaven.netlify.app/). The concept was to create a web
  forum/real-time chat application that allowed users to post user stories and
  project ideas in which to collaborate on. Making friends, reaching out,
  countless nights of long zoom calls were the things that made my experience so
  overwhelmingly rewarding and I sought a way to tell the world of new
  developers that.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I had a very simple MVP for the first week, and dove head first into
  integrating fun animations, custom artwork, and mobile responsiveness into my
  project. In 12 weeks I had truly developed some fundamental technical
  competence, and got to demonstrate that. I also had career services meetings
  each week following our introduction and was on a sure path to completing that
  course.

<Heading>Post bootcamp — Now</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  I wrote a blog last week that details some of what my life is like today:
  <BlockQuote>

      Netowrking After Coding Bootcamp
    </Link>
  </BlockQuote>
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  After graduating coding bootcamp, I have now embarked the part of my story
  where I actualize my dream. I am currently working with a local mental health
  startup called Whimser as a software engineering intern, and I have
  successfully pushed original code that I have written intro production.
  Whimser should be making a debut soon, I have been working on both the Next.js
  web application and the React Native mobile application both have been
  extremely validating.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I have also been able to start a side project with my two best friends, one
  who is a SCRUM master, and one who is just beginning to learn React with a
  vanilla JavaScript background. Having the experience of teaching someone what
  I have learned this far in a team environment, and to be learning from more
  senior engineers in a more professional environment affirms that I have made
  the right decision to change my career.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  It has not been very long since graduation, and I am extremely grateful to
  have the opportunity to work within real engineering teams. My part in this
  internship is to assist bringing the product to MVP, and it is not a long term
  position. I am actively seeking a more permanent, full-time position as a
  software engineer.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Since beginning to pursue this dream, I have overcome many obstacles and road
  blocks, and would love to talk more at length about those if someone is
  interested in my experience. Having come as far as I have, and with the
  overwhelming support I have backing me, I have no doubt that I will, in good
  time, achieve my goal of being a full-time employed software engineer.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  If you have made it this far, thank you, I am always open to meeting new
  people, working with new technologies, and helping wherever I can be useful.
</Paragraph>
