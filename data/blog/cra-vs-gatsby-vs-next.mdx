<Paragraph>
  If you are interested in frontend software development, you have probably
  heard of React. However, if you are new or newer, React is a JavaScript
  library that was built to create beautiful UI components. Most programmers add
  additional libraries to their React applications, and each of the frameworks
  in the title are based in React. There are many different cases, when and why
  you might want to use each one. In this blog I hope to lay out some of these
  cases in a digestible way so you can start building with React!

<Heading>Create-React-App</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  First, if you are brand new, create-react-app is a perfect place to start. CRA
  aims to handle the minimum needed packages and development environment support
  to get started coding in React. It gives the developer a nice experience and
  will optimize your application for deployment in production. It configures
  webpack and Babel, and you only need to have npm and Node installed to get
  started.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The best use case for CRA is developing single page applications. SPAs are
  websites that do not require refreshing when navigating through pages. This
  creates a very fast, fluid-like experience when browsing. They create home
  environments for a user, and are able to efficiently store user data locally
  during the time spent on the page. The experience is simple and easy to
  understand, it’s no wonder these applications are so popular.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The most popular examples of single page applications you may have seen are
  websites like{' '}
  <a href="http://gmail.com">
    <u>GMail</u>
  </a>{' '}
  as well as{' '}
  <a href="http://twitter.com">
    <u>Twitter</u>
  </a>

<Heading>Gatsby</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Gatsby is the best way to develop static webpages with React. Gatsby sites are
  incredibly fast to build, and they are equally quick in performance. As you
  land on one of these static websites, the most critical data is loaded first,
  following by a pre rendering of any additional data, giving the user a natural
  experience navigating its pages.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Some of the best cases to use Gatsby are personal portfolios and blogs. It
  enables performative content, in a neat and orderly package. There are also
  thousands of plugins and templates that any developer can start with to get
  off the ground quickly. You are also able to seamlessly integrate services
  like Shopify and WordPress into your website.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Popular companies that are building with Gatsby are the
  <a href="https://us.braun.com">
    <u>Braun</u>
  </a> shaving company, well as the <a href="https://www.impossiblefoods.com">
    <u>Impossible Foods'</u>
  </a> Brand website.

<Heading>Next</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Last, but certainly not least, we have NextJS by Vercel. Next is an ever
  increasingly popular framework, that truly does it all. It takes the great
  things about Gatsby, and CRA and offers them independently as well as in
  combination to developers. The team at Vercel us challenged many of the common
  problems in the React community, and delivered solutions over and over again.
  Notably Next takes a "zero config" approach, tedious things such as routing,
  styling, and code-splitting are given to you out of the box.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  After learning and loving React myself, I have fallen into a deeper more
  maddening love with NextJS and it has only just begun. The experience as a
  developer is unmatched, and with constant updates I feel Next is really the
  leading edge in React web development. Although you need not always use NextJS
  in creating React projects, it personally has been hard to look back now that
  I have gotten my feet wet.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  I actually found Next by mistake, at the very least it was indirect. I was
  searching the archives of Reddit to find a person who made an app called{' '}
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/3i5byz/tabsaver_shows_drink_deals_in_ames_now_officially/">
    <u>TabSaver</u>
  </a>{' '}
  my friends and I used in college. I found the TabSaver developer{' '}
  <a href="https://leerob.io">
    <u>Lee Robinson</u>
  </a>
  , and through his <a href="https://youtube.com/user/MaStaleee">
    <u>YouTube</u>
  </a> channel and <a href="https://masteringnextjs.com">
    <u>free course</u>
  </a> on Next, have fallen in love with the technology.
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  Websites for{' '}
  <a href="http://tiktok.com">
    <u>TikTok</u>
  </a>
  , <a href="(http://hulu.com">
    <u>Hulu</u>
  </a> ,<a href="http://twitch.tv">
    <u>Twitch</u>
  </a> as well as my hometown grocery store, <a href="https://www.hy-vee.com">
    <u>Hy-Vee</u>
  </a> are all built with NextJS.

<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

<Paragraph>
  Although I am clearly biased, all of these frameworks are great for developing
  applications with React. I myself am a newer developer and as I find new and
  interesting technologies, I will continue to share my love and passions for
  them. It’s an incredibly exciting time to be involved in web development, and
  I look forward to the coming advancements that will challenge and excite me.
